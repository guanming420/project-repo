# repo-projects

A curated collection of my personal projects, experiments, and learning work across software development and data-related topics.

This repository serves as a growing sandbox where I explore concepts, test ideas, and build small but meaningful implementations while improving code structure, tooling, and best practices.

---

## Purpose

This repository exists to:

- Consolidate my personal coding projects in one place
- Practice writing clean, readable, and reproducible code
- Experiment with different tools, libraries, and patterns
- Maintain a visible learning and progress trail over time

Projects may vary in scope and completeness, but each is created with intent rather than as throwaway code.

---

## Repository Structure

Projects are organised by folder. Each folder represents an independent project or experiment.

A typical project may include:
- Source code
- Its own dependency list
- A short README or usage notes
- Examples or test files where applicable

Not all projects use the same stack or tools.
