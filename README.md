# Objective
    This project aims to predict the 2026 NBA MVP by modeling how historical performance metrics, team success, and contextual factors have influenced past MVP voting outcomes.

# Problem Statement
    The NBA MVP award is determined through a narrative-driven voting process with inconsistent evaluation criteria across seasons.
    This lack of transparency makes MVP outcomes difficult to explain, compare, or predict.
    There is currently no standardized, metric-based framework that systematically incorporates both performance data and contextual factors in MVP evaluation.
    The desired state is a standardized, explainable framework that integrates performance metrics and contextual factors to better evaluate MVP candidacy.
